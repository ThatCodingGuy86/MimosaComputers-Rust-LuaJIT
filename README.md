## MimosaComputers Rust LuaJIT

This repository is a sister repository to [MimosaComputers](https://github.com/ThatCodingGuy86/MimosaComputers), as it is the source for the DLL required to run the mod.

The DLL is written in Rust and exports an API for the mod to interact with, and create, LuaJIT VMs.
